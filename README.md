# Simple_iPod
Interfacing to electronic components, and in particular reading from a memory, are fundamental things in any hardware system. This project is quite representative of many things that hardware designers do in the real world. I loaded the flash memory of the De1-SoC board with the song file and moved it to the audio D/A converter to listen to them. This simple iPod can play, pause, change the speed of the song, change the direction of playing the song. This project also makes use of picoblaze 8 bit microcontroller. If you implement it on De1-SoC you can see the intensity of each sound sample using LEDs
